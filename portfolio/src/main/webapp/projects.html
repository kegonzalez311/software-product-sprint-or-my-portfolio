        <h2> ACM Website </h2>
        <h3> Role: </h3>
        <p> Front-End Developer </p>
        <h3> Description: </h3>
        <p> In the ACM chapter at Gettysburg College, I and a three other peers worked on building a start up website. We developed this website to be an easy resource for computer science students to access. On our website we hope to provide opportunities for students such as club meetings, internships, etc. This project is still under the works. </p>
        <h2> GStress </h2>
        <h3> Role: </h3>
        <p> Front-End Developer </p>
        <h3> Description: </h3>
        <p> A peer and I worked on this start up website for a final project in our First-year seminar. We created the front-end of the website. This is a resource we started for Gettysburg College students. In this website we provided resources for students to cope with stress. Being in college can be very stressful and it is very important to find healthy ways to cope. </p>
